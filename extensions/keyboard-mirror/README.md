# Keyboard Practice

Practice typing with a visual keyboard overlay.

This extension launches a floating "Liquid Glass" keyboard window that mirrors your key presses in real-time. It is designed to help you practice touch typing or simply visualize your keystrokes for demonstrations.

## Features

- **Real-time Mirroring**: Visualizes every key press instantly.
- **Liquid Glass Design**: A beautiful, translucent dark mode interface.
- **Focus Free**: The window floats but never steals focus, allowing you to type in your favorite editor uninterrupted.
- **Seamless Integration**: Launches instantly from Raycast.

## Usage

1.  Run the **Keyboard Practice** command in Raycast.
2.  The keyboard overlay will appear.
3.  Type anywhere (VS Code, Notes, Browser) and watch the keys light up.
4.  Run the command again to toggle it off (or use `Cmd+Q` if focused, though it tries not to be).

## Requirements

- macOS
- Accessibility / Input Monitoring permissions (The app will guide you if needed, or inherit them from Raycast).
